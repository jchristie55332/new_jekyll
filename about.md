I'm a Software Developer working in London.  I'm currently working at one of the fastest growing EdTech startups in London.  We are working to improve Maths for Primary school kids.  Its a great project and I love being a part of it.

I am a great believer in Technology making most things better, but sometimes you do just need to read a book.  I am currently working with Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and Javascript in a variety of sudonims.

I really enjoy playing around with a some different tests/challenges so take a look at my GitHub to see what I've been working on.  They may be a little random but they tend to be things that I found interesting.

If you want to get in touch please do!! You can find my email below and I'll always get back to you.  Thanks and good night!!
