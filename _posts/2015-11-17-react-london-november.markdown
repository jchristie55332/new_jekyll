Having made it to another amazing meetup in London this evening after work, I have to say I can't understand why more people don't get invloved.  They are the most amazing opportunities for people to get to know each other over a free beer and companies to expose themselves to the market in a great light.

Visiting the Bloomberg offices in the city not only reiterates that the city boys live in a different world to the rest of us, but also that every company has its own problems and great solutions to fix them.  Bloomberg seems to be another great technically focused business that does very well by it's members of staff.  The fact that they have a brilliant space for their London opperations and still feel the need to build a new office shows that they value environment above everything else.  Something that the majority of businesses, including the one I am currently working for, could learn a lot by.  Not being pissed off by the space that you spend most of your time in during the week really is important, WHO KNEW!?!

On the technology side of things I'm not convinced by React yet.  I like the idea, and I don't think the code is too difficult (after quite limited research) so maybe I need to build an app using it.
