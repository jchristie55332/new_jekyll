Hello,

Back for another update.  As its my first real blog post on this new iteration of my site I thought it should probably be about technology.

So I have spent most of my day getting to grips with Strong Parameters.  Now I'm working on the assumption that you know a bit about Rails and you have probably heard about Strong Parameters.  I have done a lot of reading about the idea behind the update from Rails 3 to Rails 4 with regards Strong Parameters, but as it was solving a problem that does not excist for us at TSL we have managed to get by using the 'protected_attributes' gem.  I thik this gem is amazing.  It removed a lot of the leg work that we would have had to do in the upgrade proceedue from 3.2.x to 4.x.x and worked straight out of the box.  Having done some research over the weekend I came upon [this](http://carreno.me/articles/how-to-upgrade-to-strong-parameters-in-rails) article.  Now fair play for putting this together.  It seemed to make the potentail issues sound trivial (which I liked the sound of) and I loved the ideas of having a hybrid of strong parameters and protected attributes.

Now the reality in my world was it is not that simple.  It may be possible, but after a large amount of playing aroundit did not become a reality for me.  The largest issue that I have run into is Cancan.  I am not a fan of Cancan.  It has caused me problems in many projects and my next job is to remove it from the TSL project.  I have decided to go the whole hog and remove both gems and do the whole strong parameters thing properly.  Its going to be painful.  It will take me a week but it will be another job ticked off the list.

I'm not going to speak anymore about this mainly because its boring.  My motivation is to test out Rails 5.  Now that is exciting!!
