Last week I attended the New Relic Summit in London.  This was a great event for me to attend as I am just beginning to look into the world of DevOps and server optimisation.  I have recently been working at understanding how to take an empty shell of a server and deploy and run a variety of applications on them.  I'll post about this soon so I will focus on the New Relic event.

The event was hosted at the Ham Yard hotel in central London.  This is an amazing venue with a theatre space and event bar with bowling alleys in the basement.  Fantastic.  The premise of the event essentially seemed to be a sales pitch along with customer testimonials about how great New Relic are.  I found it particularly interesting that New Relic were more than happy to release figures of number of customers, costings and just quite how much data they are storing.  On the other hand the customer testimonials had gone through the marketing departments and all the interesting data very poorly shaded over.  I had no idea why though as not a single person there was interested in reporting to the press that John Lewis had x million people hit their site on Black Friday.

All in all a great event.  I didn't meet too many people of interest as the majority of people were running for the exit after the closing speeches.  Amazing given the champagne reception in the bar and bowling all night with free drinks paid for by New Relic.  I'm not convinced that my opinion of New Relic has changed.  Its a great tool.  Good to identify potentially problematic areas of code before they become a problem.  Excellent for Product Managers and CTOs to monitor their applications.  Great for big organisations where they can save the cost of 5 instances per month for effective management.  For me however, small company with good resources its EXPENSIVE.  I'll keep using it but I can catch a lot of potential issues myself by keeping vigilant.
